Git Revert – Changes ALL the files for a specific commit back to their state before that commit was completed (git revert <commit ID>). 

The reverted commit is NOT DELETED, git creates a new commit with the files reverted to their previous state.

Version control history moves forward, while the state of your files moves backwards in this case.


Adding a line that I will regret! Later I may have to use git revert!
