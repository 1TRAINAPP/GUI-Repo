git stash - saves your local changes in a temporary place where you can go back and get to them later

git stash save "Worked on new pricer function"

git stash list

git stash apply  (took all changes from the stash but did not get rid of the stash)

git stash list


git stash pop (grabs first stash in the list of stashes, applies the changes, and drops the stash)

git stash list (should show the stashes gone)

git diff (now we see our changes are back!)


This is a change I may want to stash away and come back to later !
