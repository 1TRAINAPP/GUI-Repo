git stash - saves your local changes in a temporary place where you can go back and get to them later

Example stash commands:
git stash save "Worked on new pricer function"
git stash list
git stash apply <stash> (took all changes from the stash but did not get rid of the stash)
git stash list
git stash drop <stash>
git stash list (should show the stashes gone)
git diff (now we see our changes are back!)

New Pricer function being worked on, but I may need to stash this change and come back to it later!
