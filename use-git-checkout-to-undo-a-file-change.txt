Undo "local" changes
Scenario: The cat walked across the keyboard and somehow saved the changes, then crashed the editor. 
You haven't committed those changes, though. You want to undo everything in that file—just go back to the way
 it looked in the last commit.

Undo with: git checkout -- <bad filename>
